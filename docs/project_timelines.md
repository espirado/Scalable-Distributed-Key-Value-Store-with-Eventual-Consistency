# Project Timelines & Stages

## **Overview**
This project is divided into several stages, each building on top of the previous, leading to the deployment of a highly available and scalable key-value store system. Below is a detailed breakdown of each stage along with timelines for completion.

---

### **Stage 1: Infrastructure Setup** 
- **Duration**: 1 Week
- **Goal**: Set up the foundational infrastructure using Terraform to provision an AWS EKS cluster for Kubernetes.
- **Tasks**:
  - Configure AWS CLI and Terraform.
  - Provision an EKS cluster with necessary networking (VPC, subnets, security groups).
  - Set up automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

---

### **Stage 2: Build Core Key-Value Store** 
- **Duration**: 2 Weeks
- **Goal**: Develop the core distributed key-value store logic, focusing on consistent hashing and partitioning.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement the key-value store logic in Python or Golang.
  - Integrate gRPC for inter-node communication.
  - Develop consistent hashing for data partitioning.
  - Unit testing for core features.

---

### **Stage 3: Replication and Quorum** 
- **Duration**: 2 Weeks
- **Goal**: Implement data replication and quorum-based read/write mechanisms for ensuring data availability and eventual consistency.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement replication logic (N-replication factor).
  - Develop quorum-based consistency with configurable R and W values.
  - Implement hinted handoff for handling temporary node failures.
  - Write unit and integration tests.

---

### **Stage 4: Versioning and Conflict Resolution** 
- **Duration**: 1.5 Weeks
- **Goal**: Use vector clocks to manage data versioning and handle concurrent updates.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement vector clock logic to track object versions.
  - Set up client-side conflict resolution for handling concurrent writes.
  - Develop version reconciliation mechanisms.
  - Unit testing for conflict resolution scenarios.

---

### **Stage 5: Observability and Monitoring Setup** 
- **Duration**: 2 Weeks
- **Goal**: Integrate monitoring and observability tools to track system health, performance, and reliability.
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring node health and performance.
  - Implement Jaeger for distributed tracing.
  - Integrate ELK Stack for centralized logging.
  - Set up alerting using Prometheus Alertmanager.
  - Document dashboard setup and alerting rules.

---

### **Stage 6: Fault Tolerance and Chaos Engineering** 
- **Duration**: 1 Week
- **Goal**: Ensure fault tolerance by conducting chaos engineering tests and verifying system stability under node failures.
- **Tasks**:
  - Use Chaos Mesh to simulate node and network failures.
  - Monitor how the system responds to failures and recoveries.
  - Measure system availability and adjust configurations for improved reliability.

---

### **Stage 7: Final Performance Testing and Scaling** 
- **Duration**: 2 Weeks
- **Goal**: Conduct final load testing, ensure horizontal scalability, and optimize performance.
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform load testing using Kubernetes HPA to scale nodes.
  - Optimize EKS cluster configurations for scaling and cost-effectiveness.
  - Implement backup strategies using AWS S3.
  - Document system architecture and performance metrics.
