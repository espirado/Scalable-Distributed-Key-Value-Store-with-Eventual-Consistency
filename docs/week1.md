# Week 1: Infrastructure Setup

## Subtask 1: Terraform Setup and Environment Configuration
**Duration**: 1 Day  
**Goal**: Prepare the environment for Terraform and AWS CLI configuration, ensuring secure and scalable practices.

### Tasks:
- Install and configure Terraform and AWS CLI on the local machine or CI environment.
- Set up secure access management:
  - Configure **IAM Roles** and **Policies** for the Terraform user, limiting least-privilege access.
  - Use **AWS KMS** to manage secrets and encryption for sensitive data like API keys.
- Set up remote state management using **S3 with encryption** and **DynamoDB** for state locking.

## Subtask 2: AWS VPC and Networking Design
**Duration**: 1.5 Days  
**Goal**: Architect a scalable and fault-tolerant VPC to host the EKS cluster, focusing on networking complexity.

### Tasks:
- Define and provision the **VPC** using Terraform with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs) for high availability.
- Create **NAT Gateways**, **Internet Gateways**, and ensure proper routing tables for secure communication.
- Configure **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs** with least-privilege access for the EKS cluster.
- Enable **VPC Flow Logs** and integrate with **CloudWatch** for deeper monitoring of network traffic.

## Subtask 3: EKS Cluster Provisioning
**Duration**: 2 Days  
**Goal**: Provision the EKS cluster with best practices for node scaling, networking, and integration with other AWS services.

### Tasks:
- Provision an EKS cluster using Terraform modules:
  - Enable **Fargate profiles** for serverless Kubernetes pods.
  - Configure **Managed Node Groups** for automatic scaling.
- Implement **IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)** to securely allow Kubernetes pods to access AWS services like S3, CloudWatch, etc.
- Enable **Kubernetes RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) with fine-grained permissions.
- Set up an **AWS ALB Ingress Controller** for managing external access to services running in Kubernetes.

## Subtask 4: CI/CD Pipeline for Infrastructure Deployment
**Duration**: 2 Days  
**Goal**: Establish a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Terraform code using GitHub Actions.

### Tasks:
- Set up a **GitHub Actions** pipeline for automatic Terraform plan and apply:
  - Implement checks for **Terraform syntax validation** and **security scanning** (e.g., using **TFSec** or **Checkov**).
  - Automate the Terraform plan to be triggered on pull requests for staging environments.
  - Ensure automatic approval and deployment to the production environment upon merging to the main branch.
- Integrate with **GitHub Secrets** to securely manage AWS access keys and sensitive configurations for the CI pipeline.
- Implement post-deployment validation:
  - Automated testing using **Terraform's "output" values** to verify the successful provisioning of key resources (EKS cluster, VPC, etc.).
  - Use **Terratest** or **InSpec** for infrastructure validation and compliance checks.

## Subtask 5: CI/CD Pipeline for Kubernetes Application Deployment
**Duration**: 1 Day  
**Goal**: Set up an automated pipeline for application deployment onto the provisioned EKS cluster using GitOps principles.

### Tasks:
- Set up **Argo CD** or **Flux** for GitOps-based deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.
- Automate container image build and push using **GitHub Actions**:
  - Define the pipeline to build the Docker image upon commit.
  - Push the image to **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** securely.
- Configure **Argo CD** or **Flux** to watch the GitHub repository for changes in Kubernetes manifests and automatically deploy updated resources to the EKS cluster.
- Enable **Helm charts** for managing complex Kubernetes applications and automate the Helm chart releases.

---

## Subtask 6: Logging and Monitoring Setup for EKS
**Duration**: 0.5 Days  
**Goal**: Integrate robust monitoring and logging tools for the EKS cluster to ensure observability from Day 1.

### Tasks:
- Set up **CloudWatch Container Insights** to monitor the health and performance of the EKS cluster.
- Enable **FluentD** or **Fluent Bit** for log aggregation from EKS pods into **CloudWatch Logs** or **Elasticsearch**.
- Configure **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time metrics and alerting for cluster health and application performance.
