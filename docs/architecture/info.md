# Distributed Key-Value Store Reliability Patterns
## Detailed Documentation

## 1. Data Consistency Patterns

### 1.1 Vector Clocks
Vector clocks are essential for tracking causality and managing concurrent updates in our distributed system.

#### Core Concepts
- **Logical Timestamps**: Each node maintains a vector of counters representing the event ordering across all nodes
- **Causality Tracking**: Helps determine if events are concurrent or causally related
- **Version History**: Maintains multiple versions of data when concurrent updates occur

#### Implementation Details
1. **Structure**
   - Each node maintains its own counter
   - Updates include the entire vector of known counters
   - Timestamps are added for tie-breaking

2. **Version Comparison**
   ```
   When comparing versions A and B:
   - A > B if A's counters are greater or equal to B's, with at least one being greater
   - A || B (concurrent) if some counters in A are greater and others in B are greater
   - A = B if all counters are equal
   ```

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Detect conflicts using version comparison
   - Apply application-specific merge functions
   - Use timestamps as tiebreakers
   - Optionally store multiple versions for client resolution

### 1.2 Quorum-Based Operations

#### Overview
Quorum consensus ensures consistency across replicas while maintaining availability under partial failures.

#### Configuration Components
1. **Replica Parameters**
   ```
   N = Total number of replicas
   W = Write quorum (number of successful writes required)
   R = Read quorum (number of successful reads required)
   ```

2. **Consistency Levels**
   - **Strong Consistency**: R + W > N
   - **Eventual Consistency**: Lower values of R and W
   - **Read-optimized**: Lower R, higher W
   - **Write-optimized**: Lower W, higher R

#### Operation Flow
1. **Write Operations**
   - Coordinator receives write request
   - Determines replica set based on consistent hashing
   - Attempts to write to N replicas
   - Succeeds when W acknowledgments received
   - Returns success/failure to client

2. **Read Operations**
   - Coordinator receives read request
   - Reads from R replicas
   - Performs version reconciliation
   - Returns latest version to client

## 2. Failure Handling Patterns

### 2.1 Hinted Handoff

#### Purpose
Ensures write operations succeed even when some replica nodes are temporarily unavailable.

#### Mechanism
1. **Normal Operation**
   - Write attempts to reach all replica nodes
   - Successfully written data is acknowledged
   - Failed writes are stored as hints

2. **Hint Storage**
   - Structure includes:
     * Target node identifier
     * Original timestamp
     * Expiration time
     * Operation details
     * Retry metadata

3. **Recovery Process**
   - Background process monitors node health
   - When target node recovers:
     * Hints are replayed in timestamp order
     * Successful replays are cleared
     * Failed replays are rescheduled

4. **Resource Management**
   - Hint storage is size-limited
   - Older hints expire after TTL
   - Prioritizes hints based on age and importance

### 2.2 Anti-Entropy Process

#### Purpose
Ensures eventual consistency by reconciling differences between replicas over time.

#### Components
1. **Merkle Trees**
   - Hierarchical hash structure of the keyspace
   - Efficiently identifies inconsistent ranges
   - Updated periodically with new data

2. **Synchronization Process**
   ```
   1. Generate Merkle trees for each replica
   2. Compare trees to identify differences
   3. Transfer only inconsistent ranges
   4. Verify transferred data
   5. Update local state
   ```

3. **Resource Management**
   - Rate limiting for network usage
   - Scheduled during low-traffic periods
   - Prioritizes critical inconsistencies

### 2.3 Failure Detection

#### Architecture
1. **Gossip Protocol**
   - Periodic health checks between nodes
   - Information dissemination about node states
   - Scalable communication pattern

2. **Phi Accrual Detection**
   - Adaptive failure detection
   - Probability-based thresholds
   - Considers network conditions

3. **Recovery Actions**
   - Suspicious state marking
   - Temporary node exclusion
   - Reintegration procedures

## 3. Load Balancing and Request Distribution

### 3.1 Ring Management

#### Token Distribution
1. **Virtual Nodes**
   - Multiple tokens per physical node
   - Improved load distribution
   - Better failure handling

2. **Rebalancing**
   - Gradual token redistribution
   - Minimal impact on existing operations
   - Background data movement

### 3.2 Request Routing

#### Strategy
1. **Token-Aware Routing**
   - Direct requests to optimal nodes
   - Minimize request hops
   - Consider node health

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Load-based routing
   - Latency-aware selection

## 4. Data Recovery Patterns

### 4.1 Read Repair

#### Operation
- Triggered during read operations
- Identifies and fixes inconsistencies
- Background reconciliation
- Version comparison and update

#### Priority Levels
1. **Critical Repairs**
   - Missing replicas
   - Significant version differences
   - Data corruption

2. **Background Repairs**
   - Minor version differences
   - Non-critical updates
   - Periodic consistency checks

### 4.2 Background Repair

#### Process
1. **Scheduling**
   - Regular intervals
   - Resource-aware timing
   - Configurable priorities

2. **Execution**
   - Segment-based processing
   - Incremental progress
   - Checkpointing

### 4.3 Incremental Anti-Entropy

#### Implementation
1. **Merkle Tree Management**
   - Persistent tree storage
   - Incremental updates
   - Efficient comparison

2. **Optimization**
   - Bloom filters for efficiency
   - Compression for storage
   - Batched operations
