# GitOps Workflow for Distributed Key-Value Store

## Overview

GitOps is a modern infrastructure management technique that enables teams to operate Kubernetes clusters and deploy applications by using Git as the single source of truth. In this project, we implement GitOps to manage both the application code and infrastructure. The following key aspects of GitOps will be addressed:

1. **Declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All infrastructure configurations are defined in Git using Terraform.
2. **Kubernetes Deployment with Helm**: Application deployments and configurations are handled through Helm charts stored in Git.
3. **Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions**: Automatic deployment pipelines will be triggered by commits to specific branches (e.g., `main` and `staging`).
4. **Observability**: GitOps will also manage the monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.) to ensure real-time monitoring and system health.
5. **Continuous Delivery with Argo CD**: Real-time synchronization of application state from Git to Kubernetes clusters using Argo CD.

## GitOps Workflow

1. **Git as Single Source of Truth**
   - All configuration files, application code, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and Terraform code are stored in a Git repository.
   - Changes to the infrastructure or application trigger automated CI/CD pipelines, keeping environments in sync with the state defined in Git.

2. **Infrastructure Management with Terraform**
   - **Terraform** manages the AWS infrastructure, including the EKS cluster, networking, and security configurations.
   - Terraform configurations are version-controlled in the repository under the `deploy/terraform/` directory.
   - Changes to the infrastructure configuration files trigger an automatic pipeline to provision or update the infrastructure.

3. **Application Deployment with Helm**
   - The application is containerized and deployed to the Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.
   - Helm charts are version-controlled and stored in the Git repository under the `deploy/kubernetes/` directory.
   - Changes to the application or its configurations (in Git) trigger a CI/CD pipeline that deploys the updated version to the Kubernetes cluster.

4. **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**
   - GitHub Actions will be configured to handle both application deployments and infrastructure provisioning.
   - Upon a `git push` to the `main` or `staging` branch, the corresponding GitHub Action workflow is triggered:
     - **Infrastructure**: Terraform workflows apply changes to the EKS cluster and AWS infrastructure.
     - **Application**: Helm workflows deploy updated container images and apply Kubernetes configuration changes.

5. **Argo CD for Continuous Delivery**
   - **Argo CD** continuously monitors the Git repository for changes and applies them to the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that the cluster state matches the desired state defined in Git.
   - Argo CD provides real-time monitoring of deployments, visualizing differences between the live and desired state, and enabling easy rollback or synchronization.

## GitOps Architecture

1. **Infrastructure Pipeline**
   - Trigger: A commit to the `infrastructure` directory (`deploy/terraform/`) on the `main` branch.
   - Process: 
     - Initialize Terraform.
     - Run `terraform plan` to check for infrastructure changes.
     - Run `terraform apply` to provision or update AWS resources.
   - Tools: Terraform, AWS CLI, GitHub Actions.

2. **Application Pipeline**
   - Trigger: A commit to the `application` directory (`deploy/kubernetes/`) or a Docker image update.
   - Process: 
     - Build Docker image for the key-value store application.
     - Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR or DockerHub).
     - Deploy the application using Helm charts to the EKS cluster.
   - Tools: Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions.

3. **Argo CD Pipeline**
   - Trigger: Commit changes to any application configuration (Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests).
   - Process:
     - Argo CD syncs the desired state defined in Git with the live state in the Kubernetes cluster.
     - Monitor and display application health and configuration drift.
   - Tools: Argo CD, Kubernetes.

4. **Monitoring Pipeline**
   - Trigger: A commit to monitoring configuration (`deploy/kubernetes/monitoring/`).
   - Process:
     - Apply changes to Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger configurations via Helm.
     - Ensure the updated observability stack is deployed to Kubernetes.
   - Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Helm.

## GitOps Workflow Example

1. **Feature Development**:
   - A developer creates a new feature branch from `main`.
   - They make changes to the code or infrastructure and push it to the feature branch.

2. **Pull Request**:
   - Once changes are ready, the developer creates a pull request (PR) to merge the feature branch into `staging`.
   - The CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs tests and Terraform checks, applying changes to the `staging` environment.

3. **Approval and Merge**:
   - Once approved, the PR is merged into `main`.
   - The `main` branch triggers the CI/CD pipeline to deploy changes to the production environment via GitOps.

4. **Argo CD Sync**:
   - Argo CD automatically detects changes in the Git repository and applies them to the live Kubernetes cluster.
   - Monitoring and alerts are provided in case of configuration drift or errors.

## GitOps Tools and Technologies

- **GitHub Actions**: Used for CI/CD automation to trigger Terraform, Docker builds, and Kubernetes deployments.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool for provisioning AWS infrastructure (EKS, VPC, IAM roles).
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes, used to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources declaratively.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology to build and deploy the key-value store.
- **Argo CD**: Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool to ensure that the application state in the cluster matches the Git repository.
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Monitoring stack for observing system health and performance metrics.
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for monitoring request paths across the cluster.

---

## Branching Strategy

- **main**: The production-ready code is deployed automatically from this branch to the production environment.
- **staging**: Changes are first merged into this branch for testing and QA purposes before being promoted to production.
- **feature-branches**: Used by developers to work on individual features before creating pull requests to `staging`.

## GitOps Best Practices

1. **Declarative Configurations**: Use declarative IaC and Kubernetes manifests to describe both infrastructure and application states.
2. **Immutable Deployments**: Use versioned Docker images and Helm releases to ensure reproducibility.
3. **Automation**: Automate all deployment processes using GitHub Actions and Argo CD to ensure consistency and reduce manual intervention.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly update monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger) to observe system performance.
5. **Rollbacks**: Ensure that rollbacks are simple and easy to perform by keeping previous states available in Git and using Helm and Argo CDâ€™s rollback features.
